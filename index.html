        <h1>Topic Background</h1>
        <p> The social issue that this project is centered around is reproductive rights. More specifically, we wanted to focus on abortion rights for women. The overturning of the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade has affected many women across the United States, especially women of color or low-income women who live in states that have now banned abortion. Thus, we hope to use a motorized storyboard to depict the negative results of banning abortions.</p> 


   <h1>Cause and Effect Model</h1>
   <p> The diagram below depicts a cycle of the cause and effect as a result of overturning Roe v. Wade and how it has affected the population. It brings in some explaination for why the court casewas overturn.
