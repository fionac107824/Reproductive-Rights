        <h1>Topic Background</h1>
        <p> The social issue that this project is centered around is reproductive rights. More specifically, we wanted to focus on abortion rights for women. The overturning of the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade has affected many women across the United States, especially women of color or low-income women who live in states that have now banned abortion. Thus, we hope to use a motorized storyboard to depict the negative results of banning abortions.</p> 


       <h1>Cause and Effect Model</h1>

       <img src="Cause.png" alt="The diagram depicts a cycle of the cause and effect as a result of overturning Roe v. Wade and how it has affected the population. It brings in some explaination for why the court case was overturn." width="450">
       <h1>Storyboard</h1>
       <img src="storyboard1.jpg" alt= "Photograph 1" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
       <img src="storyboard2.jpg" alt= "Photograph 1" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
       <p>The two storyboards show the progression of our charcter Anne as a pregnant woman who is unable to get an abortion after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. As a result , she is no longer able to abort her child despite not being financially stable enough to provide for a child. So, she could only turn to an illegal abortion which ultimately costs her, her life. This is also our character design.</p>
       <h1>Images and Explaination of Characters and Set</h1>
       <img src="Characters.jpg" alt="In this image all three of our characters are shwon. The lady who is evidently pregnant for dramaticization purposes is the main character Anne. Then in the blue outfit is the nursewho is the person that tells Anne that she nolonger can't get an abortion. Lastly, we have our dictor in the sea foam green scrubs that looks evdeintly scary and suspicious. He is who will perform the illegal abortion on Anne" width="450">
       <img src="Buildings.jpg" alts="In this image our building set picture is shown. These buildings were made out of cardboard paper." width= "450">     
       <p> The firts picture shows our three main charcters, Anne, the nurse and the doctor. The picture next to it shows the buildings that will be in our background that we created out of cardboard.
     <h1>Code</h1>
       <pre>
input.buttonA.onEvent(ButtonEvent.Click, function () {
    crickit.servo1.setAngle(180)
    pause(2000)
    crickit.servo1.setAngle(0)
    pause(10000)

})
        </pre>
        <p>This was the code that was connected to servos that allowed our charcters to move. Our code depicts on rotations in specific angles that are typically set to a rotation of 0 degrees or 180 degrees. In total we had four motors that connected induvidually to the nurse, Anne, the doctor and the sign that announces the overturning of Roe. Wade.</p>

    <h1>Project Reflection</h1>
        <h2>Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design</h2>
            <p>I created the buildings, the sign, the white medical bed, the nurse and her desk, and the cardboard boxes, and created Anne the main character with my partner. Each figure from the nurse to the doctor and the sign was created out of bakable clay mixed with air dry clay to make our figures stronger. Then we used small metal wires to support the inside of our characters.</p>
        <h2>Technology and Code</h2>
            <p>The software that was used for this project was cricket which controls all our motions in our motorize story box. For the programmed device, I only contributed by occasionally giving input (trying to help) with changing the way that our characters worked within our code. However, my work with my partner was split up evenly so I helped with minor details.</p>
        <h2>Social Impact, Audience, and 5 Whys</h2>
            <p>Our main focus for our project was to convey how the overturning of Roe versus Wade could affect minority women, especially women who are of low income. It would affect our attended audience because it strongly utilizes pathos, which in turn, will cause our audience to take a stand for the purpose of our project.  Our main character is a low-income woman called Anne who is pregnant and unable to support her child. As a result, she decides to abort her baby. But, she lives in Texas where Roe v Wade has been overturned so she has no choice but to turn to a legal abortion clinic. in this situation and is portrayed as a woman who has no other option than to seek something illegal that could eventually harm her well-being. With no choice, she bags a nurse at a nearby doctor's office to give her an abortion but she is curtly refused. This causes empathy for the audience when they see such a scene because she is a helpless person. Then the evil doctor which is the person that performs the illegal abortion on Anne is depicted as evil looking to invoke this kind of fear and concern for what would happen to and if she does carry out the illegal abortion. In the end, the dramatic and glaring red lights that shine between Anne interacting with the doctor create suspense that eventually leads to a red line (representing death)that passed away from the illegal abortion death rapping around Anne's neck indicating that she passed away from the abortion.  We decided to give our story a sad ending mainly to emphasize that this isn't just a story but a reality that many low-income women face especially with the overturning of Roe v Wade.   we hope that the dramatization of our project will lead our audience to understand why it is so crucial to give abortion rights to women because it is a part of their Reproductive Rights and something that is fundamental to women.</p>

        </video>
        <p> This is one of our first takes for our video. When depicting the death of Anne with our red string, the nurse was accidentally knocked off as well.</p>
